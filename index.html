        <p> I am a 3D animator who plays Team Fortress 2 when I'm not animating. I was born 10 years ago on May. I always liked watching animations and 4 years ago I said in these exact words "Why not? It shouldn't I start animating.It can't be that hard." But it was infact that hard. I couldn't figure out how to animate and settled on making posters.Now we have me now.</p>
